 <div class="left">
  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
   TF2 Stats is a web application which creates statistics about
   <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a> servers and
   their players. It is being developed by
   <a href="http://chris.smith.name/">Chris Smith</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   TF2 Stats works by analysing the log files produced by TF2 servers. It
   records all events that take place (such as kills, team changes, captures,
   and many more), and then analyses those events to produce interesting
   statistics.

  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <dl>
   <dt>Q. What happens if I change name?</dt>
   <dd>A. TF2 Stats tracks players by their Steam IDs, rather than by their
          aliases, so you can change your nickname as often as you like
          and we'll keep track of you.</dd>
   <dt>Q. How is my score calculated?</dt>
   <dd>A. Your score starts out at 1,000, and increases or decreases with
          each event that you are involved in. Most changes come from kills,
          where the killer takes a certain amount of points from their victim,
          based on the difference between their scores, their classes, and
          the weapons used.
